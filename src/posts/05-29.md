you ever feel lost?

you ever fall into a doomscroll -- comparing yourself to the autistic SF dev that hasn't stopped reading technical material since grade 4?

you ever realize that you've watched too many sub-optimal YouTube videos to ever compete at that level?

Well -- you're in the right place!

These are poasts for the normies.

The barely +1SD devs.

A place for light takes, nothing as black-pilling as a geohot blog post.

Yes. This is a true bastion for the midwits.

I hope you have fun on this journey, watching a single human find their place in society. 

Learning what it is to be outwardly well-adjusted in a sea of autism.
